A friendly website to provide information to helplines based on either the city, state or country the page is viewed in.

*I don't think this will be the final name... Depends on the best domain when it's time.*

## Contributing
Feel free to make a PR on any feature and I'll check it out and see if I like it.

I want this to be very simple and potentially help people find the resources they need.

### **Any PR that update resources are awesome and will be reviewed first**

Resources are added to the [`/src/resources.js` file](https://github.com/zacimac/its-okay/blob/main/src/resources.js)
