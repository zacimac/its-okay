# It's Okay
A friendly website to provide information to helplines based on either the city, state or country the page is viewed in.

*I don't think this will be the final name... Depends on the best domain when it's time.*

## Contributing
Feel free to make a PR on any feature and I'll check it out and see if I like it.

I want this to be very simple and potentially help people find the resources they need.

### **Any PR that update resources are awesome and will be reviewed first**

Resources are added to the [`/src/resources.js` file](https://github.com/zacimac/its-okay/blob/main/src/resources.js)
- Make sure to check the format guide at the top of the resources file too.
- If the area is for where you are, you can check the country code, region and city by opening inspect element on the page and looking at the console.
